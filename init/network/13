# 13. Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host

dig -x 10.2.4.2 +noall +answer | grep 101.fr | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/.$//' 

# -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup
# noall and then answer to remove all informations, then show only what we need.
# I then used awk to print only the name of the host cause cut wouldn't work whith the whitespace delimiter.
